# UDI Polyglot v2

Polyglot is a Middleware between the ISY Home Automation device and any number of external devices and services.

This documentation is meant to be used in order to help others to understand the code and continue the development from a community perspective.

While most of the previous code has been written in Python, the event loop driven Node.JS was chosen for this platform due to its asynchronous nature. Python can still be used as a NodeServer, or any other language you prefer.

Documentation is built in the docs folder on GitHub in HTML format if you clone the repository.
